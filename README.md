# Age Bias Analysis in Hiring Decisions

This project explores the effect of age-related bias in hiring decisions using a simulated dataset. The notebook includes data generation, model implementation, and bias analysis using both statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Contents
- **Data Generation**: Randomly simulated data for age, education, experience, and skill score.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Visualizations showing distribution of features.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of a biased and unbiased hiring decision model.
- **Key Findings**: Impact of bias and comparisons between models.

## How to Run
- Clone the repository.
- Install required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run the notebook in Jupyter to reproduce results.

## Key Findings
- Significant age bias was identified, affecting older candidates' chances of getting hired.
- Removing the bias resulted in fairer hiring decisions.
